# 📋 Task Assignment & Real-Time Sync Guide

## Overview

The Optiwork platform features **real-time task synchronization** between the Admin Portal and Employee Portal. When a supervisor assigns a task in the admin dashboard, it **immediately appears** in the employee's dashboard without requiring a page refresh.

## 🔄 How It Works

### **Architecture**

```
┌─────────────────────┐
│   Admin Portal      │
│   (Supervisor)      │
└──────────┬──────────┘
           │ Assigns Task
           ▼
┌─────────────────────┐
│   Shared State      │
│   (App.tsx)         │
│   tasks: Task[]     │
└──────────┬──────────┘
           │ Filters by userId
           ▼
┌─────────────────────┐
│  Employee Portal    │
│  (Employee)         │
│  Shows Tasks        │
└─────────────────────┘
```

### **State Management**

1. **Central State**: All tasks are stored in `App.tsx` state: `const [tasks, setTasks] = useState<Task[]>(mockTasks);`

2. **Task Assignment**: When a supervisor assigns a task via `TaskAssignment` component:
   ```typescript
   const handleAssignTask = (taskData) => {
     const newTask = {
       ...taskData,
       id: `task-${Date.now()}`,
       status: 'pending'
     };
     setTasks(prev => [...prev, newTask]); // ✅ Updates shared state
   };
   ```

3. **Task Filtering**: Each employee sees only their tasks:
   ```typescript
   const getUserTasks = () => {
     return tasks.filter(t => t.assignedTo === currentUser.id);
   };
   ```

4. **Real-Time Updates**: React automatically re-renders the `EmployeeDashboard` when `tasks` state changes.

## ✨ Visual Indicators

### **1. Admin Portal - Success Notification**

When a task is assigned, the supervisor sees:
```
✅ Task Assigned Successfully!
Task "Machine Setup - Line A" has been assigned to John Smith 
and is now visible in their employee portal.
```

### **2. Employee Portal - New Task Notification**

When a new task is assigned, the employee receives:
```
📋 New Task Assigned!
"Machine Setup - Line A" has been assigned to you.
```

### **3. Visual Badges**

Newly assigned tasks (within last 5 minutes) display:
- **Blue ring** around the task card
- **"NEW" badge** with gradient animation
- **Pulse animation** to draw attention

### **4. Notification Badge**

The bell icon in the employee header shows a **red badge** with the count of pending tasks.

---

## 🎯 Testing the Feature

### **Step 1: Open Two Browser Windows**

1. **Window 1**: Admin Portal
   - URL: `http://localhost:5173` (or your dev URL)
   - Login: `admin` / `admin123`

2. **Window 2**: Employee Portal  
   - URL: `http://localhost:5173` (or your dev URL)
   - Login: Any employee ID (e.g., `EMP001`) / `demo123`

### **Step 2: Assign a Task**

In the **Admin Portal**:

1. Click **"Assign Task"** from the dashboard
2. Fill in task details:
   - **Title**: "Test Task - Real-Time Sync"
   - **Assigned To**: Select the employee you're logged in as in Window 2
   - **Priority**: High
   - **Description**: "Testing real-time synchronization"
   - **Due Date**: Today
3. Click **"Assign Task"**

### **Step 3: Observe Real-Time Sync**

In the **Employee Portal** (Window 2):

1. ✅ Task appears **immediately** in the "Pending Tasks" section
2. ✅ **Toast notification** appears: "📋 New Task Assigned!"
3. ✅ Task card has a **blue ring** and **"NEW" badge**
4. ✅ **Bell icon** shows updated pending count

### **Step 4: Verify Task Details**

Click on the new task to verify:
- All details are correctly synced
- Task can be started/completed
- Checklist items (if any) are present

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Key Components**

#### **1. App.tsx** (Main State Container)
```typescript
const [tasks, setTasks] = useState<Task[]>(mockTasks);

const handleAssignTask = (taskData) => {
  const newTask = { ...taskData, id: `task-${Date.now()}`, status: 'pending' };
  setTasks(prev => [...prev, newTask]);
  toast.success('✅ Task Assigned Successfully!', {
    description: `Task "${newTask.title}" is now visible in employee portal.`
  });
};
```

#### **2. TaskAssignment.tsx** (Admin Component)
```typescript
const handleSubmit = (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  const newTask = { ...formData, assignedBy: currentUser.id };
  onAssignTask(newTask); // Calls App.handleAssignTask
};
```

#### **3. EmployeeDashboard.tsx** (Employee Component)
```typescript
// Detects new tasks
useEffect(() => {
  if (tasks.length > previousTaskCount) {
    const newTasksCount = tasks.length - previousTaskCount;
    toast.info('📋 New Task Assigned!', {
      description: `You have ${newTasksCount} new task(s).`
    });
  }
}, [tasks.length]);
```

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

### **New Task Indicators**

1. **Ring Animation**: Blue ring around new task cards
2. **NEW Badge**: Gradient badge with pulse animation
3. **Scale Animation**: Smooth scale-in effect when task appears
4. **Notification Badge**: Red counter on bell icon

### **Task Card Enhancement**
```typescript
const isNew = task.id.startsWith('task-') && 
  (Date.now() - parseInt(task.id.replace('task-', ''))) < 5 * 60 * 1000;
```
- Tasks are marked as "new" for **5 minutes** after creation
- Visual indicators automatically disappear after 5 minutes

## 🚀 Advanced Features

### **Smart Task Assignment**

The system also includes AI-powered task assignment that considers:
- **Employee Skills**: Matches required skills with employee expertise
- **Current Workload**: Distributes tasks evenly
- **Performance Score**: Prioritizes high performers for critical tasks
- **Shift Timing**: Assigns tasks during employee's working hours

### **Future Enhancements**

Potential improvements for production:

1. **WebSocket Integration**: For true real-time sync across devices
2. **Push Notifications**: Browser push for instant alerts
3. **Offline Support**: Queue tasks when offline, sync when online
4. **Task History**: Track all task assignments and completions
5. **Batch Assignment**: Assign multiple tasks at once

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Issue: Task not appearing immediately**

**Solution**: Check that:
1. You're logged in as the correct employee
2. The employee ID in admin matches login ID
3. Browser has not cached old state (try hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R)

### **Issue: "NEW" badge not showing**

**Solution**: The badge only shows for 5 minutes. If task was just assigned, check:
1. Task ID format is `task-{timestamp}`
2. Browser time is correct

### **Issue: Notifications not appearing**

**Solution**: Ensure:
1. Toast notifications are enabled
2. No browser notification blockers
3. Toaster component is rendered in the component tree

---

## 📝 Code Examples

### **Assign a Task (Admin)**

```typescript
const taskData = {
  title: "Machine Setup - Line A",
  description: "Prepare machine for production",
  assignedTo: "1", // John Smith's ID
  priority: "high",
  startTime: "07:00",
  endTime: "08:00",
  dueDate: "2025-10-16",
  requiredSkills: ["skill-1", "skill-6"],
  notes: "Safety equipment required"
};

onAssignTask(taskData);
```

### **View Tasks (Employee)**

```typescript
// Employee sees filtered tasks
const userTasks = getUserTasks(); // Only tasks assigned to them

// Tasks are categorized by status
const pendingTasks = userTasks.filter(t => t.status === 'pending');
const inProgressTasks = userTasks.filter(t => t.status === 'in-progress');
const completedTasks = userTasks.filter(t => t.status === 'completed');
```

## 🎓 Best Practices

1. **Always assign to valid employee IDs**: Verify employee exists before assignment
2. **Include all required fields**: Title, description, dates, priority
3. **Set realistic due dates**: Consider employee workload and shift times
4. **Add skill requirements**: Helps with smart assignment and training
5. **Use checklists for complex tasks**: Break down work into manageable steps
